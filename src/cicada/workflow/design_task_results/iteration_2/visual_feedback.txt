Based on the rendered images and the design goal, here is the analysis:

### Hits:
- **Rectangular top**: The top appears to be a rectangular shape in the images, aligning with the design goal.

### Misses:
- **Number of legs**: The table is supposed to have four cylindrical legs, but the images show only one leg.
- **Leg placement**: The single visible leg is not at the corner of the tabletop, contrary to the design specification.
- **Physical Stability**: With only one leg positioned centrally and no visible support at the corners, the table would not be stable.
- **Leg shape**: The leg at the bottom doesn't appear cylindrical, which is required for consistency with the goal.

### Suggestions:
1. **Add Additional Legs**: Ensure that there are four cylindrical legs placed at the corners of the table to meet the design specifications and provide stability.
2. **Check Leg Shape and Size**: Verify that the legs are cylindrical with the specified radius to meet design consistency.
3. **Enhance Stability**: Review the design to ensure no visible gaps between the tabletop and the legs to maintain stability.

Adjustments according to these suggestions should help align the rendered object with the specified design goals.
