describe-vlm:
  user_prompt_template: "Describe the object in the following image(s) in detail from a manufacturing perspective. Focus on unique features, relative dimensions, and construction techniques that would be useful for CAD recreation. Highlight any potential use of extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, or helix/spiral operations. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list."
  system_prompt_template: "You are an expert in manufacturing and CAD design. Provide detailed descriptions that are useful for recreating objects using CAD software. The objects in the images are presented without texture and material information, and uniformly colored with enhanced contrast to reveal details as much as possible. No standard unit of absolute dimension is provided, therefore only provide relative dimensions. Consider the following construction techniques when describing the object: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, and helix/spiral. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list."

  user_prompt_template: "Given the design goal described below and optionally a reference image, generate a list of visual quality control questions to assess if the generated mesh meets the specifications. Focus on geometry accuracy, dimensions, feature preservation, topology quality, symmetry, alignment, detail level, connectivity, manifoldness, mesh boundaries, polygon density, and self-intersections. Each question should be on a new line.\n\nDesign Goal:\n{text}\n\nReference Image: [attached if provided]"
