  user_prompt_template: "Describe the object in the following image(s) in detail from a manufacturing perspective. Focus on unique features, relative dimensions, and construction techniques that would be useful for CAD recreation. Highlight any potential use of extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, or helix/spiral operations. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list."
  system_prompt_template: "You are an expert in manufacturing and CAD design. Provide detailed descriptions that are useful for recreating objects using CAD software. The objects in the images are presented without texture and material information, and uniformly colored with enhanced contrast to reveal details as much as possible. No standard unit of absolute dimension is provided, therefore only provide relative dimensions. Consider the following construction techniques when describing the object: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, and helix/spiral. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list."

    Given the design goal described below and optionally a reference image, generate a list of visual quality control questions categorized under ['Geometry Accuracy', 'Dimensional Accuracy', 'Feature Integrity', 'Topological Integrity', 'Symmetry and Alignment', 'Mesh Quality']. Each category should have specific questions that assess whether the generated mesh meets the design specifications. Ensure that each question is clear, specific, and actionable. Provide questions in a numbered list format, with each question on a new line.

    Design Goal:
    {text}

    Reference Image: [attached if provided]

    Examples of good questions:
    - Is the overall geometry of the mesh accurate compared to the design goal?
    - Are the dimensions of the mesh components within the specified tolerances?
    - Do all features of the design goal appear correctly in the mesh?

    Please follow this format and provide questions under each category.

    You are an expert in 3D mesh quality assurance. Your task is to generate a set of specific, actionable, and categorized visual quality control questions to evaluate the fidelity and accuracy of a generated mesh against its design goal. Focus on assessing geometry accuracy, dimensional precision, feature integrity, topological correctness, symmetry and alignment, and overall mesh quality. Ensure that each question is clear and targets a particular aspect of the mesh to guide a thorough quality assessment.
