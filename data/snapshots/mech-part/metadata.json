        "### Object Description\n\nThe object is a symmetrical mechanical component with two primary features: a central cylindrical hub and a surrounding disk with a cut-out section.\n\n#### Key Features:\n1. **Central Hub:**\n   - A solid cylinder protruding from the center of a disk.\n   - Contains a small central hole (likely for a screw or shaft).\n\n2. **Surrounding Disk:**\n   - A circular disk with a significant portion removed, creating a U-shape or fork-like appearance.\n   - The disk's thickness seems uniform with a consistent width throughout.\n  \n3. **Cut-out Section:**\n   - The disk has a large, angular cut-out section, approximately 90 to 120 degrees, extending from the outer edge toward the center.\n\n#### Construction Techniques\n\n1. **Starting with the Disk:**\n   - **Sketch and Extrude:** Begin by creating a sketch of the disk\u2019s complete circular profile. Extrude this sketch to the desired thickness.\n   - **Cut-out Section:** Draw the angular section to remove on the disk\u2019s surface and use an extrusion cut operation to achieve the cut-out.\n\n2. **Creating the Central Hub:**\n   - **Sketch and Extrude:** On the same origin as the disk, sketch a smaller circle centered on the disk. Extrude it to the necessary height.\n   - **Central Hole:** Sketch a smaller circle on the top face of the hub and use an extrusion cut operation to create the central hole.\n\n3. **Final Touches:**\n   - **Filleting/Chamfering:** Apply fillets or chamfers as needed to remove sharp edges or enhance the object's aesthetic.\n   - **Mirror Operations:** If the features are entirely symmetrical, use mirror operations to ensure uniformity across the object.\n\n### CAD Drawing Plan\n\n1. **Create the Disk:**\n   - **Sketch** a circle on the XY plane with the desired diameter.\n   - **Extrude** this sketch to form the base of the disk.\n  \n2. **Cut-out Section:**\n   - On the face of the disk, **sketch** the cut-out area as a sector of the circle.\n   - Use **Trim/Extend** to refine the sketch.\n   - **Extrude Cut** the section to achieve the desired shape.\n\n3. **Central Hub:**\n   - **Sketch** a smaller circle at the disk's center.\n   - **Extrude** this to the required height for the hub.\n   - Add a **Hole** feature to the top face of the hub.\n\n4. **Finalize:**\n   - **Fillet/Chamfer** any sharp edges for smoother transitions as necessary.\n   - Ensure symmetry with **Mirror** operations if required.\n\n### Hypothetical Part List\n\nIn this scenario, the object consists of a single part with no additional components intermixed. Adjustments can be made for specific use cases (e.g., adding bearings or fastening elements as needed)."
