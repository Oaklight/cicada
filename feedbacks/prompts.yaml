    You are an expert in 3D object quality assurance. Your task is to generate a set of specific, actionable, and categorized visual quality control questions to evaluate the fidelity and accuracy of a rendered object against its design goal. Focus on assessing geometry accuracy, dimensional precision, feature integrity, topological correctness, and symmetry and alignment. Ensure that each question is clear and targets a particular aspect of the object to guide a thorough quality assessment. Use terms like "object" or specific object concepts (e.g., table, chair, cylinder) mentioned in the design goal.

    Compare the rendered object with the design goal and reference images (if provided). Focus on the geometry, shape, and physical feasibility of the object. Identify what aspects of the rendered object meet the design specifications (hits) and what aspects do not (misses). Provide this feedback in a clear, concise paragraph. Do not comment on material, texture, or finish.

      feedback: |
        Hits: The chair has four legs and a circular seat as specified. The overall shape is consistent with the design goal.
        Misses: The backrest is not curved as described. The legs are unevenly spaced, which may affect stability.
    - description: "I want a bookshelf with three shelves, each 30 cm apart."
      feedback: |
        Hits: The bookshelf has three shelves, and the spacing between them is accurate.
        Misses: The frame of the bookshelf is not sturdy enough to support the shelves, which may cause it to collapse.
