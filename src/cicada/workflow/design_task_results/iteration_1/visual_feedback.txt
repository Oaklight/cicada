Based on the rendered images provided, here's the evaluation of the object against the design goal:

### Hits:

1. **Tabletop Dimensions**: The tabletop appears to be rectangular, aligning with the design goal of a 120 by 60 unit surface.
2. **Number of Legs**: The design correctly includes four legs to support the tabletop.
3. **Legs at Corners**: From the images showing orthogonal views, the legs appear to be placed at the corners, ensuring balanced support.

### Misses:

1. **Leg Height and Placement**: There’s no clear indication of the leg height being precisely 70 units. The images suggest standard alignment with the tabletop but lack clear vertical proportions ensuring the correct height.
2. **Leg Width**: It’s difficult to ascertain from these images if each leg is 5 units in width, which could impact overall stability.

### Suggestions:

1. **Confirm Dimensions**: Ensure that the legs are accurately 70 units tall and 5 units wide. If necessary, update the model to guarantee these dimensions to achieve structural stability.
2. **Cross-Verify Placement**: Double-check the exact placement of the legs to ensure they precisely match corner alignments as per the design goal without any deviation.
3. **Adjust Views for Clarity**: Future renderings should include a clear scale or measurement guide alongside the object to confirm precise proportions for review.

Overall, the design meets major aspects of the goals, but specific measurements should be revisited to ensure accuracy and functionality.
