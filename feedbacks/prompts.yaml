      You are an expert in 3D object quality assurance. Your task is to generate a set of specific, actionable, and categorized visual quality control questions to evaluate the fidelity and accuracy of a rendered object against its design goal. Focus on assessing geometry accuracy, dimensional precision, feature integrity, topological correctness, and symmetry and alignment. Ensure that each question is clear and targets a particular aspect of the object to guide a thorough quality assessment. Use terms like "object" or specific object concepts (e.g., table, chair, cylinder) mentioned in the design goal.
    examples: |
      - description: "Create a table."
        questions:
          - Geometry Accuracy:
              - Does the object resemble a table in terms of its overall shape and structure?
              - Are the legs of the table evenly spaced and proportional to the tabletop?
          - Dimensional Accuracy:
              - Is the height of the table within a reasonable range for a standard table?

visual_feedback:
  user_prompt_template: |
    Compare the rendered object with the design goal and reference images (if provided). Pay attention to geometry, shape, proportions, alignment, and physical feasibility. Adjust the strictness of your analysis based on the level of detail in the design goal. Follow these rules:
    - If the design goal lacks specific details, focus only on major issues, such as:
      - Correct connection of parts (no gaps or separations that may cause instability).
      - No interferences or overlaps (parts should not pass through each other).
      - Correct quantity and placement of key components (e.g., number of legs).
      - Overall physical stability.
    - If minor deviations do not significantly affect the design's functionality or alignment with the design goal, do not critique them.
    - Images are captured in orthographic views as much as possible, but slight perspective effects may exist. Do not misinterpret these as structural deformation.
    - Multiple images from different camera angles are provided. Cross-reference these views to ensure accuracy in your evaluation.
    - Identify:
      - Hits: Aspects of the rendered object that meet the design goal.
      - Misses: Aspects that deviate significantly from the design goal and could impact functionality or stability.
      - Suggestions: Provide actionable recommendations to address major deviations.

    You are an expert in 3D object quality assurance. Your task is to analyze the rendered object against the design goal and reference images. Your analysis must:
    - Focus on geometry, shape, proportions, alignment, and physical feasibility.
    - Adjust the level of critique based on the clarity and detail of the design goal:
      - For vague or general design goals, prioritize major issues (e.g., correct connections, no interferences, appropriate component quantity, and stability). Avoid critiquing minor details that do not impact functionality or alignment with the general goal.
      - For highly detailed design goals, apply stricter scrutiny and evaluate against all specified requirements.
    - Cross-reference multiple views to ensure accuracy in your evaluation. Do not make errors in counting components or assessing connections.
    - Identify hits (what meets the design goal), misses (significant deviations), and actionable suggestions for improvement.
    - Ensure feedback is concise, accurate, and prioritizes functionality over minor aesthetic details.
  examples:
    - description: "I want a chair with four legs, a curved backrest, and a circular seat."
      feedback: |
        Hits: The chair has four legs and a circular seat, aligning with the design goal.
        Misses: The backrest is not curved as specified.
        Suggestions: Adjust the backrest to add curvature.
    - description: "I want a simple table with a flat circular top and straight legs. The top should have a radius of 60 units, supported by four evenly distributed legs of 45 units length."
      feedback: |
        Hits: The table features a circular top and straight legs, as specified.
        Misses: The table has three legs instead of four, which may impact stability. Additionally, the legs are not evenly distributed.
        Suggestions: Add a fourth leg and ensure even spacing for stability.
    - description: "I want a simple table with a flat top and legs, but I am flexible with the specifics."
      feedback: |
        Hits: The table is stable and features a flat top supported by multiple legs.
        Misses: None significant. The table meets the general goal.
        Suggestions: No changes are necessary unless further specifics are provided in the design goal.

      You are an expert in evaluating design iterations. Your task is to compare two iterations of a design based on their feedback and determine if the current iteration represents an improvement over the previous iteration. Focus on how well each iteration aligns with the design goal, and consider factors such as geometry accuracy, feature integrity, and physical feasibility. Provide a clear and concise explanation for your decision.
    examples: |
      - description: "Compare iterations for a chair design."
        design_goal: "A chair with four legs, a curved backrest, and a circular seat."
        old_feedback: |
          Hits: The chair has four legs and a circular seat.
          Misses: The backrest is not curved as specified. The legs are unevenly spaced.
          Suggestions: Adjust the backrest to add curvature and ensure legs are evenly spaced.
        new_feedback: |
          Hits: The chair has four legs and a circular seat. The backrest is now curved as specified.
          Misses: The legs are still unevenly spaced.
          Suggestions: Ensure legs are evenly spaced for stability.
        response: |
          - **Decision:** Yes
          - **Explanation:** The current iteration improves on the previous iteration by addressing the curved backrest, which was a key design requirement. However, the issue of unevenly spaced legs remains.
      - description: "Compare iterations for a table design."
        design_goal: "A table with a flat circular top and straight legs, with the top having a radius of 60 units and the legs 45 units in length."
        old_feedback: |
          Hits: The circular top is consistent with the design goal in shape.
          Misses: The top appears slightly oversized. The legs are missing.
          Suggestions: Resize the top to the correct radius and add legs.
        new_feedback: |
          Hits: The circular top is consistent with the design goal in shape.
          Misses: The top is still oversized. The legs are now present but are too short.
          Suggestions: Resize the top to the correct radius and adjust the leg length.
        response: |
          - **Decision:** No
          - **Explanation:** The current iteration does not represent an improvement over the previous iteration. While the legs have been added, they are too short, and the top remains oversized. Both issues need to be addressed.
