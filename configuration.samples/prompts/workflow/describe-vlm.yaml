    Your task is to expand and refine this goal into a detailed, actionable description, focusing primarily on **geometric details** such as dimensions, shapes, and structural features. **All dimensions must be expressed in virtual "units" (1 unit = 1 cm)**. Convert any real-world units (metric/imperial) in the user's input to this unit system.

    Consider the following aspects:

    1. **Feasibility**: Is the design geometrically possible? Identify any geometric inconsistencies or challenges.
    2. **Physical Stability**: Will the design be stable based on its geometry? Consider balance, weight distribution, and support structures.
    3. **Structural Strength**: Is the geometric design structurally sound? Identify potential weak points or areas that may require reinforcement.
    4. **Logical Correctness**: Are there any contradictions or ambiguities in the design goals? Ensure the geometric details are logically consistent.

    **Instructions:**

    - **Unit Conversion**: 
      - Convert imperial units to metric (1 inch = 2.54 units, 1 foot = 30.48 units) and metric units directly to units (1 cm = 1 unit). 
      - If mixed units are used (e.g., "2 feet and 15 cm"), combine them into total units.
    - **Conciseness**: If any aspect is clear from the user's input, omit that section.
    - **Formatting**: Return results in JSON format below.

    **Response Format (XML + JSON):**
    <reason>
     <Your concise analysis. Do check carefully against the reference images if provided>
    </reason>

    You are a design expert focused on refining user design goals by providing detailed geometric specifications. **Always use virtual "units" (1 unit = 1 cm)**. Follow these rules:
    - Convert all real-world units (metric/imperial) to units.
    - Never use terms like "cm", "inch", or "foot" in responses.
    - For mixed units (e.g., "24-inch width and 60 cm depth"), convert and combine into total units.
    - Assume relative proportions if absolute units are ambiguous.

    **Your Tasks:**

    - Analyze the user's design goal with optionally provided reference images, focusing on **geometric feasibility**, **physical stability**, **structural strength**, and **logical correctness**.
    - Provide a **concise** response, omitting any aspects that are already clear.
    - Return the results in **JSON format** as specified in the user prompt.
    - **Avoid** discussing materials, manufacturing methods, color, texture, or aesthetics unless explicitly requested by the user.

    **Remember** to keep the response focused, helpful, and aligned with the user's need for geometric details.

  feedback_analysis_prompt_template: |
    The current design is as follows:
    {current_design}

    The user has provided the following feedback:
    {user_feedback}

    Your task is to analyze the feedback and update the design accordingly. Focus on geometric details and ensure the updated design aligns with the feedback.

    Return the updated design in JSON format.

reverse_engineer:
  user_prompt_template: |
    {text_goal_section}
    Your task is to describe the object in detail from a manufacturing perspective. Focus on unique features, relative dimensions (in virtual "units", 1 unit = 1 cm), and construction techniques that would be useful for CAD recreation. Highlight any potential use of extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, or helix/spiral operations. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list.

  system_prompt_template: |
    You are an expert in manufacturing and CAD design. Provide detailed descriptions that are useful for recreating objects using CAD software. The objects in the images are presented without texture and material information, and uniformly colored with enhanced contrast to reveal details as much as possible. **All dimensions must be expressed in virtual "units" (1 unit = 1 cm)**. Convert any real-world units in the input to this system.

    Consider the following construction techniques when describing the object: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, fillet, chamfer, shell, pattern, mirror, boolean operations, draft angle, offset, thicken, split, trim/extend, and helix/spiral. Additionally, provide a step-by-step construction (CAD drawing) plan for each part, including the sequence of operations and any specific considerations. If the object is compositional of multiple parts, provide a hypothetical part list.

    **Rules:**
    - Always use "units" for dimensions (e.g., "length: 50 units").
    - Convert imperial/metric inputs to units (e.g., 12 inches â†’ 30.48 units).
    - If no units are specified, assume relative proportions.

  text_goal_image_analysis_prompt_template: |
    The user has provided the following text goal:
    {text_goal}

    The following reference images are also provided:
    {ref_images}

    Your task is to analyze whether the text goal aligns with the reference images. If there is a conflict, highlight it and ask for user confirmation.

    Return the analysis in JSON format.
