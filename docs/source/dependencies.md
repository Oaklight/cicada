# Dependencies

I have made a few other projects that are used to enhance the functionality of the main project. These projects are listed below:

- [autossh-tunnel-dockerized](https://github.com/Oaklight/autossh-tunnel-dockerized) - Dockerized SSH tunnel manager using autossh and YAML for secure port forwarding.
- [vectorsearch](https://github.com/Oaklight/vectorsearch) - Dockerized vector database based on pgvector, pgvectorscale and pg_search.
